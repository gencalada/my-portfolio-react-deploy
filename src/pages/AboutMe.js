      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello there! (Yes, the infamous Kenobi Star Wars reference) I’m Greg!
        I’m a passionate introvert who has taken a recent interest in building
        things with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first spark of interest in tech was at around the age of 16. I was
        simply walking the halls of my high school (Go tigers!) and I noticed a
        group of students hunched over working on what looked like the inside of
        a vacuum cleaner. It was the robotics club.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember thinking the idea of the club was tremendously enticing.
        However, not knowing how to deal with imposter syndrome, I decided to
        continue my journey towards joining the armed forces where I networked
        with many different people. Learning and gaining insight In tech from
        fellow servicemen in MOS’s like cyber networking and Information
        Technology, helped to further grow my interest in tech. But never really
        acting on that interest.
      </p>

        It wasn’t until recently having already completed my military service,
        gone to college, and being a security guard for 4 years that my interest
        was sparked again. Except this time I decided to make my way through the
        tech world through a 16-week intensive Full-stack Web Development
        Bootcamp program. It was daunting at first. Looking at the code and
        feeling like I did with the robotics club.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except with hard work and perseverance, this experience was different. I
        distinctly remember the ‘Ah-Ha!’ Moment I had when I was utilizing the
        google search engine and began to dissect the site. I was able to see in
        my head the structure of how the site was built and what is going on in
        the backend that we don’t see as the user. I was finally looking at the
        internet through a developers eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am extremely greatful to myself to have had the courage to take on this carrer change. I am excited and looking to begin a full time role where I can help a company achieve their goals.
